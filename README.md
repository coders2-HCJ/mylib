# What is Avinasen's MyLib?
Our own custom library for convenience. Obviously.
This library was inspired by jQuery, p5.js, WebGLFundamentals, and TheJenkinsComic. There is a DOM part based on jQuery, the Vector class based on p5.js's Vector, the matrix math by greggman in WebGLFundamentals, and finally the enableProgrammingInCanvas is based on TheJenkinsComic's joke about a noob coder putting the Canvas API's code directly in the canvas element (which I made this literal).
