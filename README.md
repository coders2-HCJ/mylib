# What is Avinasen's MyLib?
Our own custom library for convenience. Obviously.
This library was inspired by jQuery, p5.js, WebGLFundamentals, and TheJenkinsComic. There is a DOM part based on jQuery, the Vector class based on p5.js's Vector, the matrix math by greggman in WebGLFundamentals, and finally the enableProgrammingInCanvas is based on TheJenkinsComic's joke about a noob coder putting the Canvas API's code directly in the canvas element (which I made this literal).
# How do I use this whatchamacalit?
To access this, you can use https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coders2-HCJ/mylib/main/mylib.js (used by GitHub) or https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/coders2-HCJ/mylib/mylib.js (the same, just that you can cache it in your browser). Then you put the link you chose inside of the snippet which you put in your code:
```html
<script src="[insert link of your choice inside here without the brackets]"></script>
<script>
// your code here
</script>
```
And to use methods from mylib, just use mylib.methodName or mylib["methodName"]. To see a list of methods, I recommend using Visual Studio Code, or rather just exploring mylib.js's code yourself.
